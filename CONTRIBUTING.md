### Code Style and Formatting

ALSI.Serilog.Enrichers adheres to strict coding standards to maintain code quality and consistency across the project. We use the following tools:

- **StyleCop**: Ensures compliance with coding style rules, including naming conventions, documentation requirements, and code layout.
- **CSharpier**: An opinionated code formatter that enforces a consistent code style across the project. All code should be formatted with CSharpier before submission.
